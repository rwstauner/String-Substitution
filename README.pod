=head1 String::Substitution

This module is a collection of functions to enable
(global) substitution on a string using a replacement string or function
created at runtime.

It was designed to take in the string, pattern, and replacement string
from input at runtime and process the substitution without doing an C<eval>.

See module POD for more information.
